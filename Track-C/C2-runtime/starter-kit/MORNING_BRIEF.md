# C2 Morning Brief

## Current state

Audit and baseline are complete on the formal remote Linux host. The official
device library was absent from Git but an exact manifest-hash copy already on the
server was verified and restored. The starter now builds and R101 passes.

Public baseline is 12/100: R101 plus 4 correctness points from each legal
baseline Agent. All other Runtime requirements are still starter stubs.

## Where to review

1. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the requirement matrix and invariants.
2. `TEST_REPORT.md` for reproducible environment/baseline evidence.
3. `PROGRESS.md` for the chronological log.
4. `reports/baseline_public_report.json` for the raw grader result.

## Next action

Implement the shared Runtime state, centralized error/status mapping, allocation
registry, span validation, global sequence, and DMA command submission. Validate
R101-R103 before introducing fixed-image launch and GEMM.

## Risks

- Hidden tests are expected to stress overflow, stale handles, pending async
  lifetimes, Event rerecording, and fault recovery beyond the public cases.
- `lib/libaec_device.so` is ignored and must be supplied alongside the workspace
  for every clean formal build.
- The host does not provide `file`; use `readelf` plus `ldd` for ELF evidence.
